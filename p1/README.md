"Vagrant.configure("2")...end": This is the main configuration wrapper provided by Vagrant. It tells Vagrant that the configuration will use version 2 of the configuration object (which is the latest version).

"config.vm.box = "generic/alpine38"": This line specifies that the virtual machine will be based on the "generic/alpine38" box, which is a lightweight Linux distribution.

"config.vm.provider "virtualbox"...end": This specifies that the provider for the virtual machine is VirtualBox (a type of hypervisor or software for creating and running virtual machines). 

"vb.memory = "1024"" & "vb.cpus = "1"": These lines limit the virtual machine to use 1024 MB of RAM and 1 CPU core.

"config.vm.define "mlachhebS"...end": This block defines a machine named "mlachhebS".

"server.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.110"": This line adds a private network interface to the server. The IP address of this interface is "192.168.56.110".

The "server.vm.provision "shell"...end" block specifies a shell script that should be run as soon as the machine is provisioned. The script installs "curl", installs "k3s" (a lightweight Kubernetes distribution), prints the "node-token" (a type of credential in Kubernetes), downloads the "kubectl" binary (a command-line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters), makes it executable, and moves it into "/usr/local/bin" (a directory that's on the system's PATH).

The second "config.vm.define "mlachhebSW"...end" block is defining another machine named "mlachhebSW" and operates similarly to the "mlachhebS" machine.
